            <p>What are NFTs? Are they just a passing fad, or are they here to stay? Is there a more meaningful purpose to their existence?</p>

            <h2>The begining of blockchain</h2>
            <p>I was lucky enough to be introduced to the world of digital currencies at a very young age. It was only my second year of high school when my dad, on a whim, decided to attend a Capture the Flag (CTF) event, despite knowing nothing about IT or CTFs. While there, he met a group of students who were all incredibly passionate about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The conversations he had that day sparked a fire in him, and soon after, in me. A few weeks later, after countless talks between us, I began to grasp the basics of digital currencies and blockchain technology. Before I knew it, I had my own portfolio. I asked my dad for advice as I invested in coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA). As a kid with my first job at Maccas, it was thrilling to watch the value of my investments grow, sometimes overnight. I thought I’d discovered a secret cheat code to wealth, a kind of endgame to financial freedom. But, of course, no boom lasts forever. When I experienced my first bear market, the dream faded as quickly as it had arrived.  </p>

            <h2>History in the Making</h2>
            <p>Even though my fantasy of endless wealth was shattered, the knowledge I gained about blockchain stayed with me. I realized that cryptocurrency wasn’t just about moonshot investments—it represented something much deeper. It was the first technology that could verifiably prove ownership of digital assets. At the time, I could only scratch the surface of what this all meant. That is until NFTs entered the picture. One night, my dad came to me with news of his latest investment. “There are these digital images, generated by a computer algorithm, sold as part of a collection. There are only a limited number of them,” he said. “You can buy one for about $300.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “Three hundred dollars? For a pixelated picture?” I thought he’d lost it.</p>
            <p>Well, those silly pixelated pictures—CryptoPunks—would soon become iconic as the first wave of NFTs took over.</p>

            <p>This was all occuring around the same time that Fortnite was taking over the world. My understanding of NFTs really clicked when my dad explained them like this: “Think about Fortnite skins,” he said. “When you buy one, it’s linked to your account, but you don’t actually own it. You can’t use it outside the game, transfer it between accounts, or sell it. But if Fortnite skins were backed by blockchain, you’d have full control. You could use the skin in any game integrated with the same blockchain, decide to sell it whenever you wanted, and verify how many exist, who owns them, and the history of their value.” That’s when it hit me—NFTs weren’t just a fad. They represented the future of digital ownership. In the same way we own physical objects, blockchain could make it possible to truly own digital assets. It was more than just a craze. It was the start of a revolution in how we view and manage ownership in the digital world.</p>
