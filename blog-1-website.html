            <p>Welcome to the development of my website! In this post, I'll be sharing my experience building my website from scratch using HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>Very early on in my cybersecurity journey after consulting with multiple people in the industry, there was one piece of advice that I was given over and over again. The advice was to create an online presence that showcases your interests and skills related to cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>I took on this advice and decided I would create a blog where I can share my projects and thoughts, and also use it as an opportunity to learn more about cybersecurity in a more practical way.</p>
            <p>So without any experiance whatsoever with building websites, I decided that my first blog entry should be about the process of creating my blog site from scratch.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>I started off by watching a ground up web development YouTube series by LearnCode.Academy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc" target="_blank" aria-label="LearnCode.Academy YouTube Playlist">Building a Website from scratch</a> and once I got my first taste of editing a live server with my own code, I was hooked.</p>
            <p>I quickly picked up the basics of html and css, and was able to start piecing together my own website.</p>
            <p>I created a style plan for my blog, by visiting various blog sites and taking inspiration from the ones I liked best. I cut and pasted different styles onto a word document which formed the base template for my site.</p>
            <p>After a few days of coding with plenty of formatting issues and hours of trial and error, I eventually had a basic structure ready to be used as V1 of my blog. The next challenge was going to be uploading my site to the web, which I decided I would do through GitHub Pages.</p>
